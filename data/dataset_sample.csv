Republican tax bill retains U.S. electric vehicle tax credit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A compromise Republican tax bill released late Friday does not eliminate a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit as Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives had previously proposed. The measure follows the lead of the Senate version approved last month that did not eliminate the credit. Killing the credit could have hurt automakers like General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T). Consumers under current law are eligible for a $7,500 tax credit to defray the cost of plug-in electric vehicles. The electric vehicle tax credit starts to phase out after a manufacturer sells 200,000 plug-in vehicles. After an automaker hits that point, the $7,500 tax credit is still available for at least three more months before phasing out.  Consumers are currently allowed to take the credit on vehicles until the manufacturer hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold. Electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles. The Electric Drive Transportation Association said in a statement late Friday it was pleased the credit would remain in law. “The credit supports innovation and job creation while helping drivers access advanced vehicle technology,” the group said. More than 50 automakers and other companies and groups released a letter earlier this week urging Congress to retain the credit, including Ford Motor Co (F.N), BMW AG (BMWG.DE), GM, Uber Technologies Inc. Former President Barack Obama repeatedly proposed hiking the tax credit for electric vehicles to $10,000 and converting it to a point-of-sale rebate, but Congress did not approve the measure. Automakers face mandates from California and a dozen other states to produce a rising number of zero-emission vehicles and have said the credits are essential to meeting requirements.

"Factbox: Trump makes picks to fill security, legal posts","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced his selections for his top security posts, including the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), his national security adviser and attorney general. An official with Trump’s transition team told Reuters that Trump had chosen retired General Michael Flynn as national security adviser, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions to serve as attorney general, and U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo to lead the CIA. All three accepted, the official said.      Below are details about his selections: Sessions, 69, was the first U.S. Senator to endorse Trump’s presidential bid and has been a close ally since. A conservative from Alabama, he is serving his fourth term in the chamber, where he is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee with oversight of federal courts, immigration, crime and terrorism.  The son of a country-store owner, he is a former Army Reserve captain and served as the U.S. Attorney for Alabama’s Southern District under former President Ronald Reagan and later as Alabama’s Attorney General.  Although he was confirmed by the Senate for his U.S. Attorney post in 1981, he was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 when a Senate panel failed to advance his nomination amid allegations he had made racially-charged remarks, which he denied.  Sessions must secure confirmation by the U.S. Senate to lead the Justice Department as attorney general, but he would only need to win majority support in the chamber, which is controlled by Republicans. Sessions has long taken a tough stance on immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. During the Republican George W. Bush administration, he blasted a bipartisan effort to create a guest-worker program for illegal immigrants backed by Bush. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: RETIRED LIEUTENANT GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN Flynn, 57, was an early supporter of Trump and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. A former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), he began his U.S. Army career in 1981 and served deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. He later worked in the Office of the Director of Intelligence.        Once a registered Democrat, Flynn became head of the DIA in 2012 under President Barack Obama and but retired a year earlier than expected according to media reports and became a fierce critic of Obama’s foreign policy.  He went on to launch his own consulting firm that has come under scrutiny for its ties to a Turkish businessman. He told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday that he would sever ties with the firm to serve Trump.     Flynn has said the United States should work more with Russia on global security issues. In an August interview with the Washington Post, he defended a paid speech for state-run Russian Television.     Pompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the U.S House Select Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency (NSA) and cyber security. Pompeo also was a member of the House Select Committee on Benghazi investigating the 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Libya.  The California native graduated first in his class from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and served as a platoon leader in the U.S. Army before leaving military as a captain to attend Harvard Law School. In 1996, he moved to Kansas to launch an aircraft parts company. The firm’s decision to open a factory in Mexico came under fire when Pompeo later ran for public office. Pompeo defended his work, saying the company had created jobs in the state. His ties to Koch Industries, owned by billionaire conservative donors Charles and David Koch, has also drawn scrutiny. He won re-election in the Nov. 8 election with 61 percent of the vote, according to Kansas’s unofficial election results online. Pompeo has been critical of former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden who leaked National Security Agency information, saying in a 2014 letter that his telecast appearance at an event undermined the ideals of “fairness and freedom.”    (This version of the story was refiled to remove extraneous “to” in headline) ",politicsNews,18-Nov-16,donald_trump friday announce selection security_post adviser attorney official trump transition reuters trump retire michael_flynn attorney cia accept official detail selection session senator endorse trump ally conservative alabama fourth chamber member oversight federal_courts immigration crime terrorism owner army_reserve attorney alabama later alabama attorney confirm senate attorney deny senate_panel fail advance nomination remark deny session secure confirmation senate attorney majority chamber republicans session citizenship administration blast bush lieutenant supporter trump serves vice_chairman transition director dia army_career afghanistan iraq later director intelligence flynn dia retire accord media_reports fierce_critic obama foreign_policy launch consulting_firm scrutiny ties journal thursday sever_ties firm trump flynn united_states russia global security_issues august interview washington defend russian television pompeo congressman kansas oversee agency_nsa cyber_security pompeo member committee benghazi investigate attack compound libya california native graduate platoon leader army military attend harvard kansas launch aircraft firm decision factory mexico pompeo later public pompeo defend created_jobs koch_industrie billionaire conservative donor charles david_koch drawn scrutiny election nov_election percent vote accord kansas online pompeo critical intelligence leak information telecast appearance undermine ideals fairness freedom version refile headline,1,0

 GOP Governor’s Sr. Aide Admits Running Government Like A Business Is A Disaster,"In light of the Flint water crisis, Michigan Republicans are publicly and privately acknowledging that their party s approach to governing has been a total disaster.As Michigan s Eclectablog reports here,  despite the shiny, happy face that Gov. Snyder is putting on and despite his continuing calls for more privatization and the success of Emergency Management,  off the record, state Republicans have been quietly admitting that the GOP s plan to run government like a business  has been an utter failure. John Lindstrom, of Michigan s Gongwer News Service, detailed a string of off-the-record interviews with the state s Republican leadership here.As reported by Gongwer, All of them recognized Flint as a failure, a spectacular failure, of state government. They also worried that it was particularly a failure of their party, as they almost universally said:  Our guys. No matter the setting, or the day, or the circumstance of the conversations, or who was speaking (and not everyone speaking would have known each other), there was an almost stunning repetition to each conversation s tone: They brought up the Flint situation, and they said, unprompted, it was a failure of state government and their party. Even more telling, on February 22, Dennis Schornack, a former Sr. Policy advisor to Michigan s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, was interviewed by the Detroit Free Press.During the interview, Schornack said the Flint water crisis is the direct result of the Republican approach to governing, which promises to run government like a business.Schornack, who has plenty of insight into how the Snyder administration functions, told the Free Press, that Snyder used a  single dimension for decision-making.  He explained that Snyder uses a financial spreadsheet to make every single decision.To illustrate the point, Shornak confided that, in spite of all the talk about  Christian values,  as it turns out, Snyder s decision to oppose gay marriage was never based on his Christian beliefs, it was based on a financial spreadsheet.As the Free Press reports here, Schornack said another example of a Snyder failure related to running government like a business was his administration s handling of gay marriage, which it opposed until it was legalized by the U.S. Supreme Court. Gay marriage must be decided in the heart; safe drinking water in the laboratory,  Schornack said.But the Snyder administration used spreadsheets to address both issues, deciding gay marriage on the basis of how much it would cost the state to provide benefits to same-sex couples among state employees, he said. Schornack did not hold back when discussing how the Republican approach to governing created the Flint water crisis. Government is not a business  and it cannot be run like one,  he told the Free Press.He went on to say, The people of Flint got stuck on the losing end of decisions driven by spreadsheets instead of water quality and public health.  Having been a Snyder staffer, luckily in a spreadsheet-rich area like transportation, I lived the culture amidst its faults. Earlier this week a petition to recall Rick Snyder was approved by the Michigan Board of State Canvassers.When asked if he believes Snyder will be removed from office in November, Schornack said  The issue has totally spun out of the governor s control,  and if a recall question makes it onto the ballot,  he s dead. In light of the situation in the city of Flint, the use of the phrase  he s dead,  is entirely inappropriate.Snyder is very much alive and will continue to be alive, whether he is recalled in November or not. His political career might be dead, but he will have the luxury of living the same extravagant, greedy lifestyle he s been accustomed to, for many years to come.On the other hand, at least ten people are known to have actually died because of Snyder s poison-policy choices, which valued the almighty dollar over all things, including their health and their lives.Add to that the thousands of people who will live with the consequences of Snyder s irresponsible, immoral and illegal decisions for the rest of their lives, many of whom will die from complications associated with lead poisoning.What s worse, as the citizens of Flint struggle to cope with a crisis of monumental proportion, Republican leadership continues to put the almighty dollar before their lives and their health.On February 25, residents of Flint spoke out about the many issues that have yet to be addressed by state or federal leaders, during a town hall with Democratic presidential primary candidate Bernie Sanders.Months after the situation became public knowledge, Flint citizens still struggle to get accurate information, they continue to lack resources for healthcare and many are still faced with the challenges of collecting water from one of the designated locations in the city, without the means to do so.While state Republicans whine about the financial costs of doing the right thing in Lansing, in Washington GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz is single-handedly blocking federal funding from reaching the people of Flint.And at the front of the pack for the Republican presidential nomination is Donald Trump, a corrupt businessman, who is way more similar to Rick Snyder than GOP leaders would like to admit. Trump wants to bring the GOP s disastrous agenda for running government like a business to the entire country.If Trump s policies of hate and violence aren t enough to give you the chills, his agenda to run government like a business had better.If we don t learn from what happened in Flint, Republican leaders will bring this same dangerous agenda to every city, town and state in the country, with similarly disastrous consequences.image credit: GOP elephant from wikimedia commons, I love spreadsheets mug via Flickr",News,26-Feb-16,interview report gongwer recognize flint failure spectacular failure government worry particularly failure universally guy circumstance conversation stunning repetition conversation flint situation unprompted failure government february dennis schornack sr policy_advisor michigan snyder interview detroit interview schornack flint crisis republican approach governing promise government business schornack plenty insight function snyder dimension decision_making explain snyder financial spreadsheet decision illustrate shornak confided spite snyder decision oppose gay_marriage financial spreadsheet report schornack snyder failure relate government business administration handling gay_marriage oppose legalize supreme_court gay_marriage drinking laboratory schornack spreadsheet address issue gay_marriage basis benefit sex_couples employee schornack republican approach flint crisis government business flint lose decision spreadsheet instead quality public_health snyder staffer luckily spreadsheet transportation culture amidst fault petition recall rick_snyder approve michigan canvasser snyder remove november schornack issue totally spin governor recall ballot situation flint entirely inappropriate snyder alive alive recall november luxury extravagant greedy lifestyle accustomed actually snyder poison policy choice almighty health consequence snyder irresponsible immoral illegal decision complication associate poison citizen flint struggle cope crisis monumental proportion almighty health february resident flint issue address federal leader hall candidate bernie_sanders situation flint citizen struggle resource healthcare challenge designate location republicans whine financial lanse washington ted_cruz handedly federal_funding flint pack donald_trump corrupt businessman rick_snyder gop_leaders admit trump gop disastrous agenda government business entire trump policy hate violence aren chills agenda government business don flint dangerous agenda similarly image_credit gop elephant spreadsheet mug flickr,0,1
China pledges new funding for BRICS as group opposes protectionism,"XIAMEN, China (Reuters) - China will give $80 million in funding for BRICS cooperation plans, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Monday, while the bloc of five emerging countries pledged to oppose protectionism. Xi offered 500 million yuan ($76.4 million) for a BRICS economic and technology cooperation plan, and another $4 million for projects at the group s New Development Bank (NDB) during a three-day leaders summit in the southeastern city of Xiamen.  China s new contributions to BRICS pale in comparison to its $124 billion pledge earlier in May for Xi s own Belt and Road initiative, which aims to expand links between Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond as a new way to boost global development. The announcement came amid questions over the relevance of BRICS and China s commitment to the NDB in light of the Belt and Road initiative and the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, both key efforts by Beijing to bolster its global influence. Xi said during a plenary session at the BRICS leaders  summit that the five emerging economies - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - should increase cooperation in sectors such as trade and investment, monetary policy and finance, and sustainable development.  We should redouble our efforts to comprehensively deepen BRICS partnerships and open BRICS cooperation,  he said. Set up in 20l5 as an alternative to the World Bank, the Shanghai-headquartered NDB was seen as the first major BRICS achievement after the group came together in 2009 to press for a bigger say in the post-World War Two financial order created by Western powers. The BRICS leaders will gather in Xiamen through Tuesday, giving host China its latest chance to position itself as a bulwark of globalization in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump s  America First  agenda. A draft  Xiamen Declaration  seen by Reuters, a formal version of which is expected to be issued later, said BRICS countries will continue to firmly oppose protectionism as they are committed to an  open and inclusive  multilateral trading system. The communique emphasized the need to be vigilant in guarding against  inward-looking policies  that could hurt global market confidence, and called upon all countries to fully implement the Paris climate agreement. The summit has been overshadowed by North Korea s sixth and most powerful nuclear test, which came on Sunday just hours before Xi opened the meeting with a keynote speech, and prompted a vow of a  massive  military response from the United States if it or its allies were threatened. Though China s Foreign Ministry has condemned the test, Xi did not mention North Korea during that 45-minute address or in  his televised remarks during Monday s plenary session. The BRICS grouping said in its draft communique that it strongly deplored Pyongyang s test, but that the problem over its nuclear program should only be settled through peaceful means and dialogue.  We express deep concern over the ongoing tension and prolonged nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula,  it said. North Korea tested two ICBMs in July that could fly about 10,000 km (6,200 miles), putting many parts of the U.S. mainland within range and prompting a new round of tough international sanctions. Though angered over the tests, China - North Korea s closest ally - has lambasted the West and its allies over recent weeks for promoting the  China responsibility theory  for North Korea. The U.N. Security Council was set to meet later on Monday to discuss new sanctions against the isolated regime.  Chen Fengying, an economics expert at the state-backed China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said on the sidelines of the BRICS meeting that at the most BRICS countries will take note of the North Korean problem.   Intervention is rather difficult. Our cooperation is mainly on global governance,  she said.

Germany's far-right AfD calls for repatriation of Syrian refugees,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party called on Thursday for the repatriation of half a million Syrian refugees living in Germany, saying the war there was nearly over and that President Bashar al-Assad had urged refugees to return home. Earlier on Thursday, Syria s army declared victory over Islamic State, saying its capture of the jihadists  last town in the country marked the collapse of their three-year, hardline reign in the region. However, fighting is continuing in many areas, the United Nations says, in a complex civil war in which millions have been killed or forced to flee their homes, many to neighboring countries or to Europe.         The AfD s proposal for repatriating Syrian refugees is its first since it swept into Germany s lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, in September s federal election on an anti-immigrant platform. It is the third largest party in the new Bundestag but the proposal is very unlikely to win approval as mainstream parties including Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, the biggest bloc, have refused to work with the AfD. In its proposal, the AfD said the new German government should immediately start talks with Syrian authorities over a deal to repatriate the refugees.  This deal should ensure that the returnees will be accepted in Syria and accommodated only in safe areas,  the AfD said in a statement adding that Damascus must guarantee not to persecute  citizens who escaped the military draft. The proposal said Syrian refugees  children in Germany should now be taught the Syrian school curriculum, either by Syrian teachers already resident in Germany or by teachers sent by the Syrian government for this purpose. The statement, signed by the two party leaders Alexander Gauland and Alice Weidel, said the Syrian government should work with Germany to finance the repatriation, which they said should be free for the individual refugees. The Greens party, which is expected to join Merkel s new conservative-led coalition, said the AfD proposal showed the party to be  irresponsible, inhumane and heartless .  No subject is too abysmal, no populism is too dirty for you. Shame on you!  Greens politician Luise Amtsberg said on her Facebook account, commenting on the proposal. Immigration is one of the difficult issues where Merkel s conservative bloc, the left-leaning Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) are struggling to forge a common stance in their coalition talks. Since the beginning of the year, some 156,000 people have applied for asylum in Germany, more than 25 percent of them  from Syria, making them the biggest national group, data from the Federal Interior Ministry showed on Thursday.
